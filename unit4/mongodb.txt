Topic 1: introduction to MongoDB
To understand MongoDB, we first need to understand the problem it solves.

1. SQL(The old way) => for decades, databases were like excel spreadsheets. you had Tables(like "students"), Columns(Name, Age, Marks), and Rows (The actual data).

. The problem => it is rigid. if you define a table with 3 Columns, you cannot suddenly add a 4th Column for just one student. you have to change the entire table structure.

2. MongoDB(The NoSQL way) => MongoDB is a NoSQL(Not only SQL) database. instead of Tables, it uses Documents.

. The Solution => it is flexible. A Document is just a JSON object. one student can have 3 fields(name, age, marks) and the next student can have 5 fields (name, age , hobbies, address, phone). MongoDB doesn't care.

Why is it perfect for Node.js?
=> Node.js code uses JSON Objects.
=> MongoDB stores JSON-like Documents(technically BSON).
=> this means you don't have to convert data. you just save you javaScript directly into the database
