Topic 1: introduction to MongoDB
To understand MongoDB, we first need to understand the problem it solves.

1. SQL(The old way) => for decades, databases were like excel spreadsheets. you had Tables(like "students"), Columns(Name, Age, Marks), and Rows (The actual data).

. The problem => it is rigid. if you define a table with 3 Columns, you cannot suddenly add a 4th Column for just one student. you have to change the entire table structure.

2. MongoDB(The NoSQL way) => MongoDB is a NoSQL(Not only SQL) database. instead of Tables, it uses Documents.

. The Solution => it is flexible. A Document is just a JSON object. one student can have 3 fields(name, age, marks) and the next student can have 5 fields (name, age , hobbies, address, phone). MongoDB doesn't care.

Why is it perfect for Node.js?
=> Node.js code uses JSON Objects.
=> MongoDB stores JSON-like Documents(technically BSON).
=> this means you don't have to convert data. you just save you javaScript directly into the database

Topic 2: MongoDB database and shell installation => this is the practical part. you can't write code until the database engine is running on your laptop.

Note: MongoDB has split its tools into three parts. you need to install them in this order.

Part A: Install the Server (The engine)
This is the actual database that runs in background.

1. got to https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
2. select
    . Version: Latest (e.g., 7.x or 8.x)
    . Platform: Windows x64 (MSI)

3. click download and run the installer

4. CRITICAL STEP  during installation
    . select "complete" setup.
    . You will see a screen "Service Configuration". Ensure "Install MongoDB as a Service" is CHECKED. (This ensures it runs automatically).
    . You will see a checkbox for "Install MongoDB Compass". CHECK this. (Compass is a GUI tool, like a file explorer for your data).

part B: install the shell (mongosh)
The "Shell" is the command-line tool you use to type commands like db.users.find(). It is now a separate download.

    1. Go to the https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell
    2. Download the ZIP package for Windows.
    3. Extract the ZIP. You will find a file named mongosh.exe inside the bin folder.
    4. setup.
        . Copy mongosh.exe
        . Paste it into your MongoDB Server folder (usually C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\7.0\bin). This keeps everything in one place.
    5. Add to path(optional but recommended)
        . Copy the path to that bin folder.
        . Search Windows for "Edit the system environment variables" -> Environment Variables.
        . Select Path -> Edit -> New -> Paste the path.
        . This lets you type mongosh in any terminal window.

part C: Verify installation => lets make sure it's works before moving to the next Topic
1. Open your Command Prompt (cmd) or VS Code terminal.
2. Type: mongosh and press Enter.
3. Success: You should see a prompt that looks like test>. This means you are connected to your local database!
4. Type exit to quit.

Topic 3: MongoDB Terminalogy => database, collection, Document and field

To understand these, it helps to compare them to a traditional SQL database (like MySQL or tables in Excel), which you might have seen before.

1. database

. Definition => The top-level container. it holds all your data for a specific application.
. Analogy: This is like the Workbook file in Excel (e.g., CollegeData.xlsx).
. In MongoDB: You can have multiple databases on one server (e.g., one for your "Chat App" and another for your "School Project").

2. collection

. Definition: A group of similar records.
. Analogy: This is like a single Sheet or Tab inside your Excel workbook (e.g., a "Students" tab).
. In MongoDB: A database contains collections. For example, your CollegeData database might have a students collection and a teachers collection.
. Key Difference: In SQL, this is called a Table.

3. Document

. Definition: A single record of data.
. Analogy: This is like a single Row in your Excel sheet (e.g., Row 2, which contains all of "Ashutosh's" data).
. In MongoDB: A collection contains documents.
. Key Difference: In SQL, this is called a Row. In MongoDB, it is a JSON object.

4. field

. Definition: A specific piece of data inside a document.
. Analogy: This is like a Column Header or a specific Cell (e.g., "Name", "Age", "Email").
. In MongoDB: A document contains fields.
. Key Difference: In SQL, this is called a Column.

Visualizing the Hierarchy

// 1. DATABASE: "CollegeDB"
//    |
//    +-- 2. COLLECTION: "students"
//        |
//        +-- 3. DOCUMENT (Student 1)
//        |   {
//        |      "name": "Sunny",      <-- 4. FIELD: "name"
//        |      "age": 21,               <-- 4. FIELD: "age"
//        |      "course": "CSE"          <-- 4. FIELD: "course"
//        |   },
//        |
//        +-- 3. DOCUMENT (Student 2)
//            {
//               "name": "Rahul",
//               "age": 22
//            }
