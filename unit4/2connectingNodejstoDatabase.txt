Great. Now we are leaving the black-and-white terminal screen and moving into VS Code. We are going to make your Node.js code talk to the database.

Your syllabus distinguishes between "Connect MongoDB using Node.js" and "Introduction to Mongoose".

. MongoDB Driver => The officil, 'raw' way to connect. it allows you to run exact commands you just learned(find, insertOne) directly from javaScript
.Mongoose => a helper tool we will learn next that makes things easier.

for this section we will use 'Offical MongoDB Native Driver'

STEP1 => install the Driver => in your project folder (my-first-app), we need to install the official library that let's Node.js speak to MongoDB.

1. open you terminal
2. npm install mongodb

STEP2 => the connection code 
we will create a script that connects to the database, insert a students, finds them, updates them, and deletes them => all in one go

create a new file named mongo-driver.js
 
paste this code

// import the Mongoclient class from the library
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

// 2. Define the connection URL
// this is the default address where MongoDB runs on your computer.
const url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';

// 3. create a new client
const client = new MongoClient(url);

// 4. define the database name we want to use
const dbName = "college";

async function main() {
    try{
        // --- STEP A: CONNECT ---
        console.log('Connecting to server...');
        await client.connect();
        console.log('Connected successfully to MongoDB server!');

        // --- STEP B: SELECT DATABASE AND COLLECTION ---
        const db = client.db(dbName);
        const collection = db.collection('students');

        // --- STEP C: CREATE(INSERT) ---
        console.log('\n1. Inserting a new Student...');
        const insertResult = await collection.insertOne({
            name : "Rohan",
            age : 24,
            course : "MBA",
            city : "Mumbai"
        });

        console.log('Inserted Document: ', insertResult);

        // --- STEP D: READ(FIND) ---
        console.log('\n2. Finding the student...');
        // we use .toArray() because .find() returns a 'Cursor' (a pointer), not the data itself
        const foundDocs = await collection.find({ name : 'Rohan'}).toArray();
        console.log('Found: ', foundDocs);

        // --- STEP E: UPDATE ---
        console.log('\n3. Updating Student Age...');
        const updateResult = await collection.updateOne(
            {name : "Rohan"},
            {$set : {age : 25}}
        );
        console.log('Updated count: ', updateResult.modifiedCount);

        // STEP F: DELETE ---
        console.log('\n4. Deleting the student...');
        const deleteResult = await collection.deleteOne({name : "Rohan"});
        console.log("Deleted Count: ", deleteResult.deletedCount);

    } catch(err) {
        // This block runs if the DB is down or connection fails.
        console.log("An error occured:", err);
    } finally {
        // --- STEP G: CLOSE CONNECTION ---
        // always close the connection when you are done!
        await client.close();
        console.log('\nConnection Closed');
    }
}

// run the main function
main();

Why this is important(slightly dangerous)
The Native driver is powerful, but notice something: it didn't check our data. 
If I changed the insert line to this: collection.insertOne({ name: "Rohan", age: "TWENTY-FOUR" })

MongoDB would accept it happily. It doesn't care that age is supposed to be a number. In a real application, this is bad. We want strict rules (Schemas) like "Age MUST be a number."

This leads perfectly to the next topic in your syllabus: Introduction to Mongoose. Mongoose is the tool that adds these rules.
