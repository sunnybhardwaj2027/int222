React runs in the Browser(Client Side). Express runs on the Server(Server side). they are usually on different "origins" (eg: React on localhost:5173 and express on localhost:3000)

To connect them, we need to bridge a security gap called CORS and then use 'fetch' to send data.

here is part 5.5 => connecting React to express

1. the Backend adjustment (CORS)

=> Browsers have a security feature that blocks a website on port 5173(React) from asking for data from port 3000(Express). This is to prevent malicious sites from reading your internal servers.

To allow your React app to talk to your backend, you must explicitly allow it in express using 'cors' middleware.

in your backend terminal => npm install cors

update server.js
const cors = require(cors); <---1. import cors

app.use(cors()); <--- 2. Enable it! Now react can talk to us
